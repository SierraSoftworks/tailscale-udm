# Tailscale on Unifi Dream Machine

This repo contains the scripts necessary to install and run a [tailscale](https://tailscale.com)
instance on your [Unifi Dream Machine](https://unifi-network.ui.com/dreammachine) (UDM/UDM Pro/UDR/UDM-SE).
It does so by piggy-backing on the excellent [boostchicken/udm-utilities](https://github.com/boostchicken/udm-utilities)
to provide a persistent service and runs using Tailscale's usermode networking feature.

## UniFi OS 2.x/3.x/4.x

**ⓘ You can confirm your OS version by running `/usr/bin/ubnt-device-info firmware_detail`**

**NOTE**: UniFi OS 2.x+ support is currently in beta for this project, if you encounter any issues
please open an issue and we'll do our best to help you out. Logs and clear descriptions of the
steps you took prior to the issue occurring help immensely.

### Installation

1. Run the `install.sh` script to install the latest version of the
   Tailscale UDM package on your UDM.

   ```sh
   # Install the latest version of Tailscale UDM
   curl -sSLq https://raw.github.com/SierraSoftworks/tailscale-udm/main/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Run `tailscale up` to start Tailscale.
3. Follow the on-screen steps to configure Tailscale and connect it to your network.
4. Confirm that Tailscale is working by running `tailscale status`

### Management

#### Configuring Tailscale

You can configure Tailscale using all the normal `tailscale up` options, you should be able to
find `tailscale` on your path after installation.

```sh
tailscale up --advertise-routes=10.0.0.0/24 --advertise-exit-node --advertise-tags=tag:it
```

#### Restarting Tailscale

On UniFi OS 2.x+, Tailscale is managed using `systemd` and the `tailscaled` service. You can
restart it using the following command.

```sh
systemctl restart tailscaled
```

#### Upgrading Tailscale

Upgrading Tailscale on UniFi OS 2.x+ can be done either using `apt` or by using the `manage.sh`
helper script.

##### Using `apt`

```sh
apt update && apt install -y tailscale
```

##### Using `manage.sh`

```sh
/data/tailscale/manage.sh update

# Or, if you are connected over Tailscale and want to run the update anyway
nohup /data/tailscale/manage.sh update!
```

#### Remove Tailscale

To remove Tailscale, you can run the following command, or run the steps below manually.

```sh
/data/tailscale/manage.sh uninstall
```

##### Manual Steps

1. Kill the `tailscaled` daemon with `systemctl stop tailscaled`.
2. Remove the `tailscale` package using `dpkg -P tailscale`.
3. Remove the management script and state using `rm -Rf /data/tailscale`.

## UniFi OS 1.x (Legacy OS on UDM/UDM Pro)

**ⓘ You can confirm your OS version by running `/usr/bin/ubnt-device-info firmware_detail`**

### Installation

1. Follow the steps to install the boostchicken `on-boot-script` [here](https://github.com/boostchicken-dev/udm-utilities/tree/master/on-boot-script).

   ⚠ Make sure that you exit the `unifi-os` shell before moving onto step 2 (or you won't be able to find the `/mnt/data` directory).

2. Run the `install.sh` script to install the latest version of the
   Tailscale UDM package on your UDM.

   ```sh
   # Install the latest version of Tailscale UDM
   curl -sSLq https://raw.github.com/SierraSoftworks/tailscale-udm/main/install.sh | sh
   ```

3. Start Tailscale using `/mnt/data/tailscale/tailscale up`.
4. Follow the on-screen steps to configure `tailscale` and connect it to your network.
5. Confirm that Tailscale is working by running `/mnt/data/tailscale/tailscale status`

### Management

#### Configuring Tailscale

You can configure Tailscale using all the normal `tailscale up` options, you'll find the binary at
`/mnt/data/tailscale/tailscale`. _Unfortunately we can't make changes to your `$PATH` to expose the
normal `tailscale` command, so you'll need to specify the full path when calling it._

```sh
/mnt/data/tailscale/tailscale up --advertise-routes=10.0.0.0/24 --advertise-exit-node --advertise-tags=tag:it
```

#### Restarting Tailscale

The `manage.sh` script takes care of installing, starting, stopping, updating, and uninstalling Tailscale.
Run it without any arguments to see the options.

```sh
/mnt/data/tailscale/manage.sh restart
```

#### Upgrading Tailscale

```sh
/mnt/data/tailscale/manage.sh update

# Or, if you are connected over Tailscale and want to run the update anyway
nohup /mnt/data/tailscale/manage.sh update!
```

#### Remove Tailscale

To remove Tailscale, you can run the following command, or run the steps below manually.

```sh
/mnt/data/tailscale/manage.sh uninstall
```

##### Manual Steps

1. Kill the `tailscaled` daemon with `killall tailscaled`.
2. Remove the boot script using `rm /mnt/data/on_boot.d/10-tailscaled.sh`
3. Have tailscale cleanup after itself using `/mnt/data/tailscale/tailscaled --cleanup`.
4. Remove the tailscale binaries and state using `rm -Rf /mnt/data/tailscale`.

## Contributing

There are clearly lots of folks who are interested in running Tailscale on their UDMs. If
you're one of those people and have an idea for how this can be improved, please create a
PR and we'll be more than happy to incorporate the changes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I advertise routes?

You do this by updating your Tailscale configuration as you would on any other machine,
just remember to provide the full path to the `tailscale` binary when doing so.

```sh
# Specify the routes you'd like to advertise using their CIDR notation

# UniFi OS 1.x
/mnt/data/tailscale/tailscale up --advertise-routes="10.0.0.0/24,192.168.0.0/24"

# UniFi OS 2.x/3.x
tailscale up --advertise-routes="10.0.0.0/24,192.168.0.0/24"
```

### Can I route traffic from machines on my local network to Tailscale endpoints automatically?

Yes! As of January 30, 2025, [two][1] [changes][2] to Tailscale have made this
possible. Much credit goes to @tomvoss, who contributed significant effort to
the initial implementation, detailed [here][tailnet-routing-discussion].
Before going further please read tailscale's [subnet router
documentation][tailscale-subnet-router-docs] and familiarize yourself with the
concepts of subnet routers, independent of Unifi OS.

#### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, please review Tailscale’s [subnet router
documentation][tailscale-subnet-router-docs] to understand the core concepts of
subnet routing, independent of UniFi OS.

Note: You do not need to manually enable `net.ipv4.ip_forward` on your UniFi OS
device—it is enabled by default. If you want to confirm its status, run:

```sh
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
```

#### Installation and Configuration

If Tailscale is already installed, update its configuration:

WARNING: Please be sure to do this over a local connection (not tailscale) as
your connection will be disrupted.

1. Remove the `--tun userspace-networking` flag from `/etc/default/tailscaled`.

2. Add the following instead:

   ```text
   --socket=/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock
   ```

   `FLAGS` in `/etc/default/tailscaled` should look something like this:

   ```text
   FLAGS="--state=/data/tailscale/tailscaled.state --socket=/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock"
   ```

3. Restart the Tailscale daemon:

   ```sh
   systemctl restart tailscaled
   ```

In order to persist the changes made to `/etc/default/tailscaled` you MUST
modify `/data/tailscale/tailscale-env` also, i.e.

```text
PORT="41641"
TAILSCALED_FLAGS="--socket=/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock"
TAILSCALE_FLAGS=""
TAILSCALE_AUTOUPDATE="true"
TAILSCALE_CHANNEL="stable"
```

If Tailscale is not yet installed, first export the required environment variable:

```
export TAILSCALED_FLAGS="--socket=/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock"
```

Then, proceed with the [installation steps](#installation).

#### Verifying Your Setup

To ensure that Tailscale is running correctly, check for the existence of the
tailscale0 network interface:

```sh
ip link show tailscale0
```

A successful setup should return output similar to:

```text
129: tailscale0: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1280 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 500
    link/none
```

If you see the following error instead, it means you are still running in
[userspace networking mode][tailscale-userspace-networking-docs], which will not
work:

```text
Device "tailscale0" does not exist.
```

#### Final Configuration

Once you have verified that you are not running in userspace networking mode, proceed with configuring Tailscale:

```sh
tailscale up --advertise-exit-node --advertise-routes="<one-or-more-local-subnets>" --snat-subnet-routes=false --accept-routes --reset
```

Example:

```sh
tailscale up --advertise-exit-node --advertise-routes="10.0.0.0/24" --snat-subnet-routes=false --accept-routes --reset
```

For more details on available options, see the official [tailscale up command documentation][tailscale-up-docs].

### Why can't I see a network interface for Tailscale?

By default, Tailscale runs as a userspace networking component on the UDM rather than as a TUN
interface, which means you won't see it in the `ip addr` list.

### Does this support Tailscale SSH?

You bet, make sure you're running the latest version of Tailscale and then run `tailscale up --ssh`
to enable it. You'll need to setup SSH ACLs in your account by following
[this guide](https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh/).

```sh
# UniFi OS 1.x
# Update Tailscale to its latest version
/mnt/data/tailscale/manage.sh update!

# Enable SSH advertisment through Tailscale
/mnt/data/tailscale/tailscale up --ssh

# UniFi OS 2.x/3.x
# Update Tailscale to its latest version
/data/tailscale/manage.sh update!

# Enable SSH advertisment through Tailscale
tailscale up --ssh
```
