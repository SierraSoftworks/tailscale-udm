# Tailscale on Unifi Dream Machine
This repo contains the scripts necessary to install and run a [tailscale](https://tailscale.com)
instance on your [Unifi Dream Machine](https://unifi-network.ui.com/dreammachine) (UDM/UDM Pro).
It does so by piggy-backing on the excellent [boostchicken/udm-utilities](https://github.com/boostchicken/udm-utilities)
to provide a persistent service and runs using Tailscale's usermode networking feature.

## Installation
1. Follow the steps to install the boostchicken `on-boot-script` [here](https://github.com/boostchicken/udm-utilities/tree/master/on-boot-script).
2. Run the `install.sh` script to install `tailscale` and the startup script on your UDM.
   
   ```sh
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juandp77/tailscale-udm/main/install.sh | sh
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen steps to configure `tailscale` and connect it to your network.
4. Confirm that `tailscale` is working by running `/mnt/data/tailscale/tailscale status`
